An example reactive service using Vert.x WebClient to show random jokes via http, uses the temurin images for a multistage build for the container and deploy it on to Openshift developer sandbox 

This application was generated using http://start.vertx.io

== Building

```
# To launch your tests:
./mvnw clean test

# To package your application:
./mvnw clean package

# To run your application:
./mvnw clean compile exec:java
```

Building a docker image with Eclipse Temurin
```
docker build -t com.example/vertx-jokes-jar -f docker-maven/Dockerfile .
```

Running the container image
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 com.example/vertx-jokes-jar
```

Check if everything is running

```
~/g/vertx-jokes (main)> http localhost:8080/joke
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
content-length: 151
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "type": "success",
    "value": {
        "categories": [],
        "id": 616,
        "joke": "John Doe made the sun by rubbing his hands together."
    }
}

```


Using JKube to deploy to Openshift and Kube does not use temurin for this.

#### For OpenShift

```
# Below command will create your OpenShift resource descriptors.
mvn clean oc:resource -Popenshift

# Now start S2I build  by hitting the build goal.
mvn package oc:build -Popenshift

# Below command will deploy your application on OpenShift cluster.
mvn oc:deploy -Popenshift
```

#### For Kubernetes

```
# Below command will create your Kubernetes resource descriptors.
mvn clean k8s:resource -Pkubernetes

# Now start docker build  by hitting the build goal.
mvn package k8s:build -Pkubernetes

# Below command will deploy your application on Kubernetes cluster.
mvn k8s:deploy -Pkubernetes
```
